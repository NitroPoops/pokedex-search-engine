# Brief

### Task
Oh dear!! A super trainer needs urgent access to your Pokedex super search engine to gather information on their pokemons, however, you have lost your program and need to rewrite it! Your task is to implement a Pokedex super search engine that should be able to  
• display selected number of Pokemons with their types and statistics  
• display the first Pokemon of a Type of the trainer’s choice  
• display all Pokemons with Total Base stat of the trainer’s choice  
• display all Pokemons with a minimum set of stats  
• display all legendary Pokemons of Types of the trainer’s choice  
  
### Bonus Task!!  
Surprise the super trainer with a “surprise me!” option.  
  
### What are the requirements?  
Pokedex super search engine should include the following:  
• a menu function to display all options  
• each option should be written as a separate function  
• meaningful docstring for each function  
• validation of user input  
• appropriate/meaningful comments  
• meaningful variable names should be used  
  
### When should this be done?  
The super trainer really needs to use Pokedex super search engine by Term 2 week 2 to gather information on the pokemons which will help him very much in his training to win the fights!
